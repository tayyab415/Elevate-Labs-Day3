SQL for Data Analysis Assignment Description
This assignment focuses on using SQL to extract and analyze data from a database. The objective is to practice fundamental SQL concepts, including SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), subqueries, aggregate functions (SUM, AVG), views, and query optimization with indexes. 
The task requires working with the "employees" dataset in MySQL Workbench on a Mac, using MySQL as the database tool. The submission contents include the "employees" dataset `employees_dump.sql` (as a reference or .sql file if required), a PDF containing screenshots of query outputs `day3-sql-codes.pdf`, and a .sql file with the SQL queries `day3-elevatelabs.sql`. The goal is to learn how to manipulate and query structured data effectively using SQL.

##  How to Use

### Import the Database

> Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.

From your terminal:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < employees_dump.sql
